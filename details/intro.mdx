I completed my Masterâ€™s in Information Technology from Arizona State University in May 2024, graduating with a 4.0/4.0 GPA. As a passionate and dedicated full-stack software developer, I am now seeking job opportunities. I am eager to apply my knowledge of new technologies to enhance application functionality, availability, latency, and scalability. I have a strong enthusiasm for building business solutions and features using Agile methodology, and I possess expertise in designing database architectures and integrating them with grounded applications. Outside of work, I enjoy outdoor activities and socializing.
